This decentralized application (DApp) allows users to participate in prediction markets. Users can create markets, place bets on various outcomes, and claim their rewards based on real-time price feeds from the Pyth Network.

## Features

- **Market Initialization:** Create prediction markets with specific target prices and durations.
- **Dynamic Odds Calculation:** Place bets with dynamically calculated odds based on the current state of the market.
- **Real-Time Price Feeds:** Integrate real-time price data from the Pyth Network.
